This pack is the second in a series of three (it may go to four)
that will parallel the THEY HUNGER episodes with multiplayer
models of the characters from our game.

This model pack contains several of the characters from
episode 2 of THEY HUNGER.  It also contains the main
project development team, as a joke :)

All these models are based on my original Single Player
models, which were either completely new or based on
Half-Life itself.

Models included:

- Airline Pilot (Dave Waters)
- Dr. Einar
- Dr. Franklin
- Gangster (Jack Cooper)
- NYPD Cop
- Orderly
- Patient
- Worker (Neil Manke)
- Zork

NOTE: No models in this pack currently support team colors,
      sorry for any inconvienance this may cause.

NOTE2: If you review any of these models, please notify me
       with a link to your review :)
