"PC GAMER presents: They Hunger - Episodes 1 and 2"

        Are you tired of always fighting the same
        Half-Life enemies?

        Then accept our invitation for a vacation
        in a quiet and welcoming small town...

        "They Hunger": finally a traditional horror
        story with no aliens!

You're a writer who saw some success in the past but is now
struggling to complete your latest work. Your publisher rents you
a house in the country and you are on your way there to rest,
write, and recoup. During the course of your drive the relaxing
radio music is broken by a hurried announcement, "This is BMRF
radio bringing you a special news report! Unknown atmospheric
phenomena have been reported throughout the area. Meteorologists
have been unable to identify the source of the strange electrical
displays but we will keep you informed of any developements. We
return you now to our regular programming".

"... ah, probably nothing", you think.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

IMPORTANT!!! ....BEFORE PLAYING
-------------------------------

NOTE: "They Hunger" is horror themed, it is not a military action
game like original Half-Life. So don't expect aliens or grunts
this time. Keep this idea in mind and I believe you will enjoy it 
much more. Also, because of the twilight setting, play in a dark 
room and make sure to adjust your gamma so that it looks as it 
should. You should be able to 'just' barely see well in the open 
outdoor areas with shadows being nice and dark. The sky should not 
look grainy! The black areas of the sky are 'pure' black so if they 
are anything but, your video adjustment is wrong!

Default video card settings are certainly NOT necessarily proper, 
and gamma can vary wildly between games ... a small gamma difference 
in levels, such as these, with a low lighting level, can make a big 
difference in the visuals! And don't forget HalfLife has a
flashlight [f], you will need it!

-some verbal messages are very important so listen carefully.

-you will need to know how to 'crouch-jump' and how to 'creep' 
[walk slow] to make it through this pak. This is covered in the 
Halflife training course, and it 'may' be in the HalfLife game
manual?

-if you use movement type cheat codes you will disrupt the normal 
course of events and may even get stuck in your progress through 
the levels.

-explore all areas well before moving on... there are many secret
spots in "They Hunger".

-remember: the best way to kill an evil creature is to target its
head... if it has one!:]

Known Bugs/nonbugs      : There are a couple CD tracks designated
                          in "They Hunger", playing the CD usually
                          causes the game to stutter. You can
                          disable the CD in options.
